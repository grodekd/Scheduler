Things To Do:

    Change size to fullscreen, update text size, proportional locations?
    Room Add/Edit (might not be able to do add for now becaue concern #1)
        Room edit export?
    Requests Page
    MULTIPLE ROOMS OF SAME (LL)

    SCHDULE ALGORITHM

Things Done That Need Testing:

    Employee Add/Edit Form Validation
    Fix Add new child to add to proper dataTable
    See if the unknown kids in an upload could be added automatically
    Add school impact on upload
    Check if loading thread can be removed. (Not sure if it will ever matter since the slow part is UI loading)
    Check if DB gives an id when adding and Write to DB on Add (It does)
    Change label1 text checking to enum
    Main Page Data
        Child Data
        Employee Data
        Room Data with warning logic


Concerns:

    Rooms in employee and child add/edit aren't scalable so they wont reflect new rooms.
    Update All was removed since it makes a lot less sense with the child upload, but it could come back.

Improvements:

    Change DB to have seperate tables for each rooms so the bulk list of children doesn't need to be broken apart each time in ChildService.
        Doesn't seem to slow the system down at all at 300 children

No Longer Doing:
    
    Update employee in db - NOT DOING
    Child Add/Edit db calls - NOT DOING
